# Java DSA Practice

This repository contains my practice code for mastering Java fundamentals and preparing for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) interviews. These small programs help build a strong base in core programming concepts using Java.

## 📁 File Descriptions

| File Name | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `aish.java` | A personal practice file, possibly a collection of test cases or learning snippets. |
| `areaofcircle.java` | Calculates the area of a circle using radius input and the formula `π * r^2`. |
| `arithmetic.java` | Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in Java. |
| `chardatatype.java` | Example program working with the `char` data type. |
| `DivisionofDatatype.java` | Shows division behavior across different Java data types. |
| `incrementdecrement.java` | Demonstrates the use of increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators. |
| `printingnumbers.java` | Prints sequences or specific patterns using loops. |
| `sumofnumbers.java` | Takes numbers as input and outputs their sum. |
| `variables.java` | Demonstrates declaration and initialization of variables. |

## ✅ Topics Covered

- Java Syntax & Structure
- Data Types (int, float, char, etc.)
- Arithmetic & Logical Operations
- Input/Output using `Scanner`
- Variable Declaration and Use
- Basic Loops and Conditional Statements

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-dsa-practice.git
   cd java-dsa-practice

   
📚 Prerequisites
JDK 8 or later

A code editor like IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or Eclipse

💡 Motivation
These programs are part of my preparation for technical interviews and placements. The aim is to build a strong foundation in problem-solving using Java, and eventually move on to more advanced DSA problems.

📌 Notes
More structured DSA problems (Arrays, Strings, Recursion, etc.) will be added in future commits.

Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
